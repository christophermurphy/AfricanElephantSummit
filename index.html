<a name="preamble" class="anchor" href="#preamble"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Preamble</h2>

<p>The representatives of governments along the illegal ivory value chain and inter-governmental 
organizations: </p>

<p>RECALLING that the African elephant range States adopted in 2010 the African Elephant Action Plan and the African Elephant Fund and that these mechanisms were commended by the Parties to CITES at the 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties. </p>

<p>RECOGNIZING that the conservation of the African Elephant requires a comprehensive approach, as enshrined in the African Elephant Action Plan, emphasizing the challenges of habitat fragmentation and loss, illegal killing and growing human elephant conflict. </p>

<p>NOTING that elephant poaching and the illegal ivory trade are a major concern across Africa and beyond, with serious security, economic, political and ecological ramifications as these crimes increase in frequency and severity and expand into previously secure elephant populations. </p>

<p>AWARE that in some cases, transnational criminal organizations and armed groups are using sophisticated military equipment and tactics to kill elephants and are taking advantage of high-level corruption, or lack of border security, to move ivory across borders and to avoid detection and prosecution. </p>

<p>Further AWARE that corruption can fuel and facilitate illicit ivory trafficking and that a zero-tolerance policy on corruption for all levels and sectors, including investigations and prosecutions, is warranted in this regard. </p>

<p>RECOGNIZING that poaching and illegal ivory trade are serious, often transnational crimes, which significantly impact on wildlife but also on national and international peace, security, social, cultural and political development and the rule of law. </p>

<p>RECOGNIZING that the cross-cutting nature of the problem requires effective collaboration and collective action across all agencies, including law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies, customs, the judiciary and prosecutors, foreign and finance ministries, as well as CITES authorities and natural resource ministries, nationally and internationally. </p>

<p>Further RECOGNIZING that action is required at all points along the illegal ivory value chain, both to conserve African elephants in the field, and to cut off the flow of illegal ivory. </p>

<p>UNDERSTANDING that measures to combat wildlife crime should respect the rights and livelihoods of rural communities and seek to engage them as important stakeholders in these efforts. </p>

<p>RECOGNIZING that sustainable use of natural resources has generated economic benefits  that have contributed directly to the conservation of the species, rural development and poverty reduction in a number of countries. </p>

<p>ACKNOWLEDGING the various ongoing initiatives, declarations, and existing commitments at national, regional and international levels. </p>

<p>We, the delegates assembled: </p>

<p>AGREE to safeguard the men and women who risk their lives to protect elephants in the wild and make the necessary human, financial and logistical resources available at the national and regional level to the practical extent possible to address elephant poaching on the African continent and the illegal ivory trade across the world in recognition and support of the African Elephant Action Plan. </p>

<p>URGE all donors to provide resources and support, as appropriate, for the implementation of the urgent measures and to support technical assistance, advisory services, the sharing of best practices and other forms of assistance. </p>

<p>DEDICATE OURSELVES to providing political support at the highest level to ensure the implementation of the following urgent measures in the context of the African Elephant Action Plan within the agreed timeline.</p>
